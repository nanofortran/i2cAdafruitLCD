/*
This code uses the Johnny-Five library/module to control the MCP23008
expander board found on the Adafruit I2C LCD backpack (Product No. 292)
cited here: https://www.adafruit.com/products/292, and thus control
the Hitachi HD44780 LCD conroller.

The work is based upon earlier Arduino libraries from LadyAda and others,
but is mainly grounded in the inspired work of Donald Weimann, whose
seminal monograph on the instracacies of the HD44780 can be found
here: http://web.alfredstate.edu/weimandn/  It is _truly_ worth a read.
Portions of Weiman's naming schemes, diagrams, and annotations have been 
retained for pedagogical purposes.

Thank you Mr. Weiman and LadyAda for contributing to the commons!

/******************************* Program Notes ******************************
 
This program uses an 4-bit data interface but does not use the busy flag to 
determine when the LCD controller is ready.  The LCD RW line (pin 5) is not 
connected to the uProcessor and it must be connected to GND for the program 
to function. NOTE: Adafruit's I2C LCD Backpack complies by having this pin 
grounded by default.

NOTE: In 4-bit mode, data is send as two 4-bit nibbles in succession.
 
All time delays are longer than those specified in most datasheets in order to 
accommodate slower than normal LCD modules.  This requirement is well documented 
but almost always ignored.  The information is in a note at the bottom of the right 
hand (Execution Time) column of the instruction set.
 
************************** MCP23008 & RASPI *****************************
The MCP23008 pin out and datasheet:
<https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/MCP23008.pdf>

The HD44780 pin out and datasheet:
https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/HD44780.pdf

The four data lines and two control lines as designed by Adafruit connect pins
GP1, GP2, GP2, GP4, GP5, and GP6 to the HD44780 controller pins RE, E, D4, D5, 
D6, and D7, respectively.

The connections to the I2C backpack might vary according to your RasPi model, 
for the Model B, SDA/GPIO3 connects to DATA, SCL/GPIO5 to CLOCK, 5Volts to +5v, 
and GND to GND.

The code to implement turning on and off of the backlight has not been included
